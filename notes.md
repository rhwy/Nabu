* node lib to print with style : https://github.com/chalk/chalk


## Ideas

### Style
* chainable style?
* provide api to create it's own patterns: 
    ex ->    
    `var error = ConsoleStyle.Bold.BgRed.White;`
    then use it: `Console.Write(error("arrg!"));`
* templates in complement to fluent api? 
    ```
    var msg = "normal text |Â #red`text`"
    ```
* it has to be able to print to console with style and be able to return
raw text if we want to print to a file. eventually, we could also want to output 
to html with style. 
* implement Background colors too (use escape ansi code rgb : 48;2;r;g;b)
